<p>Hi my name is Manu Gajanan. I am currently a junior at the University of Pittsburgh studying Music Composition and Film Studies. Before transferring to the main campus, I attended the Bradford regional campus for two years. As I learned more about myself and what I wanted to do with my life, I figured that moving to a city would be advantageous for my intended career path (music/film industry). I enjoy many, if not all forms of art, film, food, culture, and outdoor activities such as hiking, skiing, and playing flag football.
