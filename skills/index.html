  <p>  Area of focus: image design. I plan on using images taken from a music studio and creating an interactive layout that demonstrates a narrative for my production. 
    I plan on utilizing Lynda and learning strategies on creating a "vintage" feel. Lynda/YouTube will also assist me in layering images, and being able to use the space that I am working with. 
    I want to work on layering images in a way to create a thematic sequence. One idea I was thinking about was showing the process of making a song through image layering. 
    Capturing these photographs will also play an essential role in putting in the time needed for this assignment. 
    I intend on studying YouTube videos to be able to capture clear photographs, and then applying filters/effects to enhance the vintage feel. 
    Hopefully my vision can be carried out. I do not want to involve much white space in this design. I want all the pictures to be able to flow into one another and efffectively integrate it in my design. 
    Another idea I was thinking about was possible creating hyperlinks within the image(s) that would lead to the actual song that the pictures were representing. Integrating the song into the page was also another idea I had in mind. 
    Through doing image design and spending possibly more than 20 hours on this, I will be able to show the world my skills in music and design concepts as well. It will truly contribute to my future wellbeing and will make me a more well-rounded individual.
